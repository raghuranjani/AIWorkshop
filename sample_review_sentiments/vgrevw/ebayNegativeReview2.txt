Ive used ebay almost since its inception..since they changed its policy on protecting buyers it has become unusable. I rarely use E bay now as its rare for buyers to follow through with transactions. On 2 occasions i was 'forced' to refund money after a customer changed their mind. I lost a sale because someone else wanted it. The buyer did not read the location and so did not want to drive half an hour to pick it up and opened up a file case against me ! 2 other items ive sold have not been paid for and 2 other scams later i now very rarely use Ebay
