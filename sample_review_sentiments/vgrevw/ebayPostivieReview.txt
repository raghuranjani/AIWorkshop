,I've bought 2 items of clothing and I'm very happy. I basically bought these to test the sizing, and it's right on point. You must read the size chart because items are sent from different places. Measure yourself, if your a plus size person, go a size bigger. Don't expect to look like the petite model in the picture lol.
