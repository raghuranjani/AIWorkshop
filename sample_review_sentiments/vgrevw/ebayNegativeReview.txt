Cost $450 to sell a $1300 coffee machine in fees and charges, even charged a$40 fee by PayPal just because customer paid that way. They will not put the money in your account instead they hang on to it and tell you that it needs to clear, after a week you call them and still no money has been paid as it turns out eBay and PayPal expect Australian sellers to carry their business while they hang on to your money and pay the freight on top of sending off your item without received payment. WTH? Wait for it if the buyer is unhappy he or she then returns the item at your cost again and the money is then giving back to the buyer and you are left with the freight charges, the selling fees, the listing fees, insertion fee, PayPal’s fee, freight fee that eBay charges, gst on top of this and the reality is you have not sold anything! They take 45% of your money and screw you. Use any other site to sell your goods but not this one. They will access your account and help themselves and demand that they are entitled to it! Help clean up Australia and get rid of these foreign parasites milking our economy.
